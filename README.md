# bongard-solver

A Clojure library designed to solve Bongard Problems (BPs).


Huge thanks to Foundalis, my initial dataset is pulled form their representations of the original problems presented by Bongard M.M. in "Pattern Recognition" 1967


### Dataset
The index of BP images that serve as input to the solver reside in ./resources/images
The related dictionary of solutions is in .csv format in ./resources/data

## Problem:
Given n images, produce a description of difference between the left and right sides of a BP


#### Sub-problems:
